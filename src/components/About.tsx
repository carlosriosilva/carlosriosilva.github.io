            Passionate about technology, automation, and building scalable,
            efficient systems, I am a Software Engineer with extensive experience in
            configuration management and infrastructure operations.

          <p>
            With a strong background in DevOps practices and cloud-native
            technologies, I have successfully helped companies automate workflows,
            streamline processes, and reduce deployment times. I am proficient in a
            variety of tools such as Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and
            AWS, and have worked extensively with CI/CD pipelines, container
            orchestration, and system monitoring.

          <p>
            My goal is to continue evolving in the field of software engineering,
            bringing innovation to every challenge and delivering high-impact
            solutions that drive business success.
